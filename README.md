Description: To help the users to find new homes and upload rent for the users is the main theme of this project. Here the user can sign up for 2 different Categories: Home Renter, who is seraching for home. And other one is Landowner, who will post for To-let. Home Renter can only see the details of the house and the landowner can upload the images and also give the details of the house. 
However, there is also another user called Admin. The Admin has the power to delete or update the user details. 
Github could not upload the project since it had too many files. Here is the drive link for this project: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VXViv3qMjlyouI-WN91RlhlCPhFZnEdP?usp=sharing 
Extracting the file will do the trick.
